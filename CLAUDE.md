# CLAUDE.md

Valve/Source SDK C++ with AlliedModders-specific modernizations. Keep edits local, conservative, and consistent with the surrounding file. Never reformat unrelated code.

This file is the Claude Code adaptation of [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which is the upstream-owned source of these conventions. When upstream updates `AGENTS.md`, re-sync this file.

## Repository Orientation

- Treat this repository root as the working directory unless the task explicitly points elsewhere.
- Prefer existing project helpers, naming conventions, container types, allocation patterns, and platform abstractions over new generic utilities.
- Source is mainly C and C++. Tooling is CMake, JSON manifests, and platform-specific SDK directories.
- Preserve compatibility with existing Source SDK code. Do not introduce modern C++ facilities into old subsystems unless nearby code already uses them or the task requires it.
- Do not sort includes unless the touched file already uses sorted include groups — [.clang-format](.clang-format) sets `SortIncludes: false` intentionally.

## Tooling

- Use Read / Grep / Glob for reading and searching. Do not shell out to `cat`, `grep`, `rg`, `find`, `sed`, or `head`.
- Use Edit for partial changes; Write only for new files or a full replacement of a file already read.
- Bash/PowerShell are for git, cmake, ninja, and other real commands — not file inspection.

## Formatting

Follow [.clang-format](.clang-format) first, then the local file style.

- Tabs for indentation. Tab width and indent width are 4.
- Allman braces:

```cpp
if ( bEnabled )
{
	DoWork();
}
```

- Spaces inside parentheses for declarations, calls, expressions, and control statements:

```cpp
Foo( nArgCount );
if ( bCondition )
if constexpr ( COMPILER_CONDITION )
while ( true )
```

- Spaces inside angle brackets for templates:

```cpp
template < size_t SIZE >
CBufferStringN< SIZE >
```

- Same visual spacing for explicit casts in edited code:

```cpp
( int )( nValue )
static_cast< int >( nValue )
```

- Spaces inside braced initializer lists and short macro bodies containing values or statements:

```cpp
int nValues[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
#define Assert_BSO( exp ) { if ( IsStackAllocated() ) Assert( exp ); }
```

- No space before `(` for function declarations, definitions, and calls; a space before `(` for control statements:

```cpp
void SetValue( int nValue );
SetValue( nValue );

if ( bReady )
for ( int i = 0; i < nCount; ++i )
FOR_EACH_VEC( vecArgs, i )
```

- Pointer and reference markers bind to the variable name, not the type:

```cpp
const char *pString;
CBufferString &sBuffer;
CUtlString sString;
void *pData;
```

- Keep short inline functions on one line only when that matches surrounding code and stays readable:

```cpp
int Length() const { return m_nLength; }
```

- `ColumnLimit: 0` — keep long argument, template, and call lists on one line when the surrounding code does. Do not wrap purely because a line is long.
- Avoid alignment-only churn. Do not realign unrelated declarations, assignments, comments, or tables.
- Keep the existing line endings and encoding of the file being edited.

## Naming

- Preserve Source-style prefixes and Hungarian-like conventions:
	- `p` pointers (`pString`, `pData`), `n` integer counts/sizes (`nLen`, `nCount`), `b` booleans (`bAllowHeapAllocation`), `m_` members (`m_nLength`).
	- `C` for classes, `I` for interfaces, `_t` suffix for many enum/struct typedef-style names.
	- `M` prefix for compile-time metaprogramming structures and traits.
- Do not rename symbols to modernize them. Keep public ABI/API names stable unless the task is explicitly a rename.

## C++ Practices

- Prefer existing project types and APIs — `CBufferString`, `CUtlString`, `CUtlBuffer`, `CUtlVector`, `CUtlLeanVector`, `Q_*` / `V_*` string helpers, `Assert`, `Move`, platform abstraction headers — when nearby code uses them.
- Be careful with ownership and allocation. Many modules have custom allocation, fixed-buffer, stack-buffer, or platform-specific lifetime expectations.
- Preserve binary layout, vtable layout, exported symbols, calling conventions, and public header contracts.
- Avoid exceptions and RTTI-dependent designs unless the surrounding subsystem already uses them.
- Keep platform guards precise. Do not widen `_WIN32`, POSIX, Xbox, PS3, or dedicated-server paths casually.
- When adding overloads or templates to public headers, weigh compile-time cost and ABI/API ambiguity.
- Comments explain non-obvious constraints, compatibility requirements, reverse-engineered behavior, or ownership rules. Never restate the code.

## Reverse Engineering and Binary Work

For anything involving signatures, offsets, vtables, calling conventions, binary compatibility, gamedata, disassembly, or behavior reconstructed from a binary:

- The `ida-mcp-*` MCP servers (`ida-mcp-13337` … `ida-mcp-13341`, one per open IDA instance on `127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`) are the primary source for IDA-derived facts. Their tool schemas are deferred — load them with ToolSearch (`select:mcp__ida-mcp-13337__decompile,...`) before calling. `server_health` identifies which binary a port has open; check that before trusting a port number.
- For IDAPython scripting (`py_eval` / `py_exec_file`), invoke the `ida-pro-mcp:idapython` skill first.
- Prefer direct evidence — functions, xrefs, names, types, strings, decompiler output — over memory or inference.
- Never invent addresses, offsets, signatures, symbol names, or vtable indexes. If IDA is unavailable, say so explicitly and use repository evidence only.
- Record important IDA-derived assumptions in the final response or a nearby technical comment when the code would otherwise be hard to justify.
- For gamedata/signature changes, verify game, engine branch, platform, and binary version. Keep platform-specific entries separated; do not broaden a signature without evidence.
- Every binary-reconstructed structure or class with a known size gets `COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT( sizeof( TypeName ) == 0xSize );` near the declaration that owns the layout. Use the size verified from the target binary, and guard platform- or branch-specific sizes with the matching preprocessor conditions.
- Use string references as primary orientation when reconstructing fields: nearby literals, xrefs, logging/assert messages, schema names, RTTI/typeinfo, constructor/destructor references. Do not infer a semantic name from offset alone when string evidence exists.
- Preserve exact field offsets and padding. Use explicit padding members only when the real field type or purpose is unknown, and name them so the offset range is clear.
- Preserve exact vtable slot order. Never reorder, remove, or collapse virtual methods because their purpose is unknown — if a slot exists in the binary, the SDK declaration keeps a corresponding slot.
- Mark unknown virtuals as `Unk_IntendedMethodName( void *p )` when a plausible name is known but the signature is not. Keep the placeholder in its exact slot and prefer a single opaque `void *p` until the signature is verified.
- If neither name nor signature is known, use a slot-preserving name carrying the vtable index or offset; rename only once binary evidence supports the real meaning.
- When a signature is partially known, do not "improve" it with guessed argument types. Keep opaque placeholders and document what evidence would replace them.

## CMake Conventions

- Project-owned CMake lives under [cmake/](cmake/) and [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt). `thirdparty/protobuf/**` CMake is vendored — do not touch it unless the task is explicitly about vendored protobuf.
- Style: lowercase built-in commands, uppercase project variables, tabs, multi-line `set()` / `list(APPEND ...)`:

```cmake
set(SOURCESDK_TIER1_SOURCE_FILES
	${SOURCESDK_TIER1_DIR}/bitbuf.cpp
	${SOURCESDK_TIER1_DIR}/tier1.cpp
)
```

- Preserve the aggregate-list pattern. `SOURCESDK_SOURCE_FILES`, `SOURCESDK_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `SOURCESDK_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_LIBRARIES`, `PLATFORM_COMPILE_OPTIONS`, `PLATFORM_LINK_OPTIONS`, and `PLATFORM_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` are intentionally accumulated across included modules.
- When adding sources, include dirs, definitions, link options, or libraries, append to the nearest existing `SOURCESDK_<MODULE>_*`, `SOURCESDK_*`, or `PLATFORM_*` list instead of bypassing the module structure.
- Keep platform detection centralized in [cmake/platform/shared.cmake](cmake/platform/shared.cmake). Use the repository booleans `WINDOWS`, `LINUX`, `MACOS` rather than adding new direct checks. Platform-specific compiler/linker flags belong in [cmake/platform/windows.cmake](cmake/platform/windows.cmake), [linux.cmake](cmake/platform/linux.cmake), [macos.cmake](cmake/platform/macos.cmake).
- Extend existing root options before adding a new cache option:
	- `SOURCESDK_GAME_TARGET` selects the manifest entry from [CMakeGameManifests.json](CMakeGameManifests.json) (default `cs2`).
	- `SOURCESDK_AM_DEFINES` enables the manifest `am_defines` block.
	- `SOURCESDK_COMPILE_PROTOBUF` controls whether protobuf is built/generated here.
	- `SOURCESDK_CREATE_INTEFACE_OVERRIDE` (spelling as-is) for a custom `CreateInterface`; `SOURCESDK_ENABLE_TESTS` builds [tests/](tests/).
	- `SOURCESDK_CONFIGURE_EXPORT_MAP`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_ENABLE_RPATH`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_USE_MOLD`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_STRIP_SYMBOLS`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_STRIP_CPP_EXPORTS` control Unix link behavior.
	- `SOURCESDK_LINK_TIER0`, `SOURCESDK_LINK_STEAMWORKS` control imported shared libraries.
	- `SOURCESDK_MALLOC_OVERRIDE`, `SOURCESDK_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`, `SOURCESDK_USE_ABI0` affect ABI/runtime compatibility.
- `append_sourcesdk_shared_library( LIB_NAME LIB_FILENAME_OUT IMPLIB_FILENAME_OUT )` resolves imported binary paths under `lib/<platform>/`, returns shared-library and import-library filenames through parent-scope outputs, and may copy/patch Linux shared libraries when `SOURCESDK_LINK_STRIP_CPP_EXPORTS` is on. Reuse it for imported Source SDK shared libraries such as `tier0` and `steam_api`.
- `sourcesdk_parse_game_manifests(...)` recursively parses `CMakeGameManifests.json`, follows `inherits`, extracts `name`, `game_dir`, `protobufs_dir`, `defines`, conditional `am_defines`, and contributes `SE_NAME`, `SE_GAME_DIR`, and game-specific definitions. Keep inherited entries minimal and validate configure output for the selected `SOURCESDK_GAME_TARGET`.
- `append_proto_dirs( OUT_ARGS PROTO_DIRS )` converts proto include dirs into `-I...` arguments and writes to the named parent-scope variable — pass list variables carefully.
- `sourcesdk_compile_protos( PROTO_FILENAMES PROTO_ARGS PROTO_DIR PROTO_OUTPUT_DIR LOGS_DIR ERROR_LOGS_DIR PROTO_OUT_PREFIX )` invokes the repository `protoc`, creates output/log/error dirs, and skips files whose `.pb.cc` already exists. Do not replace it with ad hoc `execute_process()`.
- Protobuf selection is driven by `SOURCESDK_PROTOS`, `SOURCESDK_CUSTOM_PROTOS`, `SOURCESDK_SKIP_PROTOS`, `SOURCESDK_CUSTOM_SKIP_PROTOS` — entries are base names without `.proto`. Generated outputs live under `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/protos`; do not commit generated `.pb.*` unless the task requires it.
- [cmake/sourcesdk/proto/clean_prev.cmake](cmake/sourcesdk/proto/clean_prev.cmake) deletes stale generated proto headers from `common/` when `SOURCESDK_GAME_TARGET` changes. It performs file deletion during configure — change it carefully.
- Target modules under [cmake/sourcesdk/targets/](cmake/sourcesdk/targets/) create static project libraries or imported shared libraries and expose `${PROJECT_NAME}::<target>` aliases. Follow the existing target-property block for C/C++ standards, MSVC runtime, macOS architecture, compile options, definitions, includes, and link libraries.
- Keep binary-compatibility flags deliberate. Do not casually change `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`, export maps, RPATH, MSVC runtime selection, SSE flags, or `_WIN32`/`POSIX` definitions.

## Build and Verification

Pick the narrowest useful verification:

| Change | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Header-only / formatting | formatting check or a targeted compile |
| C++ implementation | build the smallest relevant target, or the existing test/compile command |
| CMake / tooling | `cmake --preset <name>` configure, or the relevant preset build |
| Gamedata | validate JSON syntax; verify signatures/offsets against binary evidence |

- Presets live in [CMakePresets.json](CMakePresets.json): `VisualStudio` and the Ninja configs `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `Release`. All enable `SOURCESDK_ENABLE_TESTS`. Build dirs are `build/<hostSystemName>/<presetName>`.
- Do not run expensive full builds unless the risk justifies it or the user asks.
- If verification could not be run, state exactly what was not run and why. Never report a build or test as passing that you did not observe pass.

## Git and Workspace Safety

- The worktree may contain user changes. Do not reset, checkout, delete, or rewrite files you did not intentionally modify.
- Check `git status --short` before and after repository edits.
- Commits, branch operations, rebases, and force updates are out of scope unless the user explicitly requests them.
- Do not modify generated files unless the task requires it.

## Commit Message Style

Match the style already dominant on the branch you are committing to.

- **This fork's own history** uses conventional-commit prefixes: `fix: correct size check for CWorldRendererMgr`, `feat: add CVariableBitString`.
- **Upstream style**, documented in `AGENTS.md`, is short imperative with a capitalized verb — `Add`, `Update`, `Remove`, `Fix`, `Correct`, `Move`, `Actualize`. Use it for commits intended to go upstream.

Either way, keep the subject concise and technical, one line unless a body is requested, and put C++ symbols, interfaces, classes, methods, and file-like identifiers in backticks:

```text
Add `CFieldPath` class
Update `CEntityIndex` & `CPlayerSlot`
Fix missing `AddRef` in `CSmartPtr::CopyFrom`
```

For CMake-only changes a `CMake:` prefix is acceptable:

```text
CMake: add `cs2-beta` game
```

Avoid vague subjects such as `build fix` or typoed verbs, even where older history contains them. When adding an AI co-author, use a trailer after a blank line:

```text
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Documentation

- Write technical documentation in clear English.
- Prefer direct, operational guidance over broad style advice.
- Keep examples short and matching the project's C++ style.
- Update nearby documentation when behavior, public APIs, build flags, or gamedata formats change.

## Context Compaction

When the session is compacted, the summary must preserve the current task, repository state, files changed, commands run, verification status, open risks, and exact next steps.

This `CLAUDE.md` stays in force across compaction. After compaction, keep following it strictly rather than reverting to generic defaults — especially the code style, CMake conventions, `ida-mcp-*` usage for reverse-engineering work, and workspace safety rules.
